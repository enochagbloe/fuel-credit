Below is the finalized flow of the app for the User, Attendant, and Admin, integrating all concepts from our discussion.



 1. User Flow (Fuel Buyer)
 A. Registration/Onboarding
1. User downloads the app and creates an account.
    Provides details: Name, Phone Number, Email.
    Completes KYC (if required) to enable credit functionality:(optional to now)
      Uploads ID or verification documents.(optional for now)
    Initial credit limit (e.g., GHS 100) assigned for new users.
2. Logs into their account and lands on the Dashboard.


B. Initiating a Fuel Transaction
1. At the Fuel Station:
    User approaches fuel attendant, who provides a QR code.
    User scans the QR code (using the builtin app scanner).

2. Filling Transaction Details:
    The app autofills hidden QR metadata (station name, attendant ID, etc.).
    The user enters:
      Type of fuel (e.g., petrol, diesel, premium).
      Amount (in liters or GHS).
      Payment Method:
        Credit (Buy now, repay later).
        Debit (Pay immediately).
    Confirms the request, which is sent to the attendant’s app.

C. Confirmation and Dispensing
1. Pending Approval:
    The attendant reviews the request on their app.
    Once confirmed by the attendant, the process is finalized, and fuel is dispensed.

2. Transaction Completion:
    The user gets a notification for a completed transaction.
    The app updates:
      Points (allocated based on payment method and timeliness).
      Remaining credit balance (if payment was on credit).



 D. Credit Management
1. User Dashboard for Credit Tracking:
    Users can view:
      Current credit limit (e.g., GHS 100).

      Repayment history.
2. Repayment:
    User pays outstanding balances via:
      Payment Gateway Integration (Mobile Money, Card, etc.).

    Points are earned based on repayment:
	//the user gets points for paying instantly 
      Early Repayment: 3 points.
      OnTime Repayment: 2 points.
      Late Repayment: 1 point.
